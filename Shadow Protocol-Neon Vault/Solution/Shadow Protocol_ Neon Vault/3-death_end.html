            <h1> YOU HAVE DIED!
            <br>“"The world spins out of focus as the harsh sound of the alarm blares in your ears. You were so close. So close to rewriting history. But now, as the lights flicker and die around you, the hum of the vault's security systems is the last thing you hear. The metallic taste of blood fills your mouth, and your vision fades as the cold grip of death tightens around your chest. The last thing you see is the faint glimmer of Tokyo’s skyline, a city that will never know the truth. Your family will hold your goodbye letter in their hands, but they’ll never know what you sacrificed. The legend of the Neon Vault will remain just that—a myth, and your name will be erased from its history forever. No one will ever know what you did. You were a shadow in the night, and now you’ve returned to it."”
