            <h1> YOU HAVE DIED!
            <br>The world spins out of focus as the harsh sound of guards rushing to find you dead. You were so so close to rewriting history. But now, as the lights flicker and die around you, the hum of the vault's security systems is the last thing you hear. The metallic taste of blood fills your mouth, and your vision fades as the cold grip of death tightens around your chest. Tokyo, a city that will never know the truth from within the thick vault walls, Legends of the Neon Vault will remain just a myth echoeing through alleys and markets and , and your name will be erased from its history forever. Your family will hold your goodbye letter in their hands, but theyâ€™ll never know the reason for your absence. No one will ever know what you did.
