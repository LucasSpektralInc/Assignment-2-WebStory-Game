            <h1> YOU HAVE BEEN ARRESTED!
            <br>“"The neon-lit streets of Tokyo buzz with the hum of the city, but to you, it feels like a tomb. You never thought they would catch you—not this time, not with everything you’ve done. But as the SpecOps drag you through the crowd, their cold, unfeeling hands gripping your arms, you realize your time has run out. The weight of your failure presses down on you like the weight of the city itself. Your family will receive your goodbye letter, and they’ll mourn, but your legacy will be confined to an empty cell, a footnote in a story you’ll never get to finish. You tried to change the world, but in the end, the system had the last word. The world will never know what you did, only what you’ve become—another prisoner of the shadows."”
